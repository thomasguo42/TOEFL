        "text": "Urban planners in rapidly growing subtropical cities are experimenting with cooling corridors—linked parks and shaded streets that guide prevailing winds into overheated districts. Inspired by traditional hutong layouts in Beijing, these corridors prioritize narrow passages that funnel breezes while blocking glare. Remote sensing teams map the hottest surfaces each summer so landscape architects can plant drought-tolerant trees along the precise routes that transport relief.",

        "text": "Yet the projects can falter when maintenance budgets remain tied to short election cycles. Newly planted trees require three years of irrigation before their canopies deliver noticeable shade, but councillors often redirect funding after the first season because voters expect instant cooling. Community cooperatives in Guangzhou address this gap by collecting water from rooftop cisterns and scheduling weekend mulching brigades, ensuring the saplings survive beyond the political calendar.",

        "text": "As corridors mature, data from wearable sensors show that residents who commute along the shaded routes experience lower heart rates during heat waves. Hospitals report fewer dehydration admissions from neighborhoods adjacent to the connected greenways, particularly among elderly residents. These early health outcomes convince skeptical policymakers that investment in patient, community-led maintenance produces measurable public-health dividends.",
